  * new popup functions popupTable, popupGraph and popupImage.
  * functions to turn coordinates into spatial lines or spatial polygons.
  * mapview objects now work natively on shiny applications (i.e. renderMapview and mapviewOutput now available).
  * zcol + burst now plots one layer for each unique value of zcol.

changes:
  * colors: viridis based colors now default if viridisLite package is available.
  * basemaps: new default basemap is "CartoDB.Positron" as colors of features are better visible on the grey background.

bugfixes:
  * if attribute was of class "character" mapview did through an error if passed to zcol.
